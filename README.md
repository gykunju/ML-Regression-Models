# REGRESSION MODELS
The project contains three different Analysis and prediction models
 - California Housing
 - Blueberry Project
 - Real Estate

### California Housing Price Prediction
## Overview
This project involves building and evaluating a linear regression model to predict housing prices in California based on various features such as median income, housing median age, total rooms, and more. The goal is to understand the relationship between these features and housing prices and to create a model that can accurately predict the price of a house given its features.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

## Data Importation and Exploration

The California Housing dataset is loaded using pandas and initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the structure and distribution of the data.

Various features are visualized to identify potential correlations and trends.

## Data Preprocessing
The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables (if any), and scale the features.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure that the model is evaluated on unseen data.

## Model Building
A linear regression model is implemented using the scikit-learn library.

The model is trained on the training set, and its coefficients are analyzed to understand the impact of each feature on the housing price.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Residual plots and other visualizations are used to assess the model's fit and to check for any patterns in the residuals that might indicate issues like heteroscedasticity.

## Model Interpretation
The coefficients of the linear regression model are interpreted to understand the relationship between the features and the target variable (housing price).

Insights are drawn from the model about which features are most influential in predicting housing prices.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The findings from the model evaluation are summarized, and recommendations are provided on how the model can be used in a real-world setting.

Suggestions for improving the model or extending the analysis are discussed.

## Key Findings
### Feature Importance:
The analysis reveals the key features that most strongly predict housing prices, such as median income and house age.

## Model Performance:

The linear regression model provides a baseline performance for predicting housing prices. The evaluation metrics give an indication of how well the model generalizes to new data.

## Tools and Libraries
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- scikit-learn: For implementing the linear regression model and evaluation metrics.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
